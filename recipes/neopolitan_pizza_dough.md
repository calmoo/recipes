## Ingredients 

Makes 2 pizza bases

###  Dough:

- 284g Tipo 00 flour (Or bread flour, use a bit more probably)
- 170g Water
- 4.25g Salt
- 2.85g Sugar
- 2.85g Instant yeast

### Forming Dough

1. Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk to combine. 
2. Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains.
3. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.
4. Knead on low speed for an additional ten minutes. The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. 
5. Transfer dough to bowl or ziplock bag, ferment for at least 8 hours, up to 3 days.


### Shaping Dough

1. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. 
2. Divide the dough into two pieces 
3. Shape dough into taught balls
4. Grease a bowl and allow to rise for 2 hours.

### Shape into pies

1. Take dough out, gently pat down ball, preserving edges until disc shaped.
2. Throw onto your knuckles and let the base hang and stretch. Watch for tears.
